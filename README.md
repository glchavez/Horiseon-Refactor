# Horiseon-Refactor

## Description

This repository (Horiseon-Refactor) was about improving the accessibility of a current web page for the fictional company Horiseon. Given a starting html and css file, I was able to implement my knowledge and skill to refactor the web page into something that was more accessible and organized for other users. The opportunity to practice my web development skills in a simulated real-world situation was of great motivation, providing me with a sense of what is to come in this career feild.

In addition to making the web page more accessible, fixing minor errors and organizing the css file was of top priority. Within the html file I added semantic html elements, corrected a partially functioning navigation bar, and created a descriptive title of the web page. Within the css file I added comments of what each bit of code was responsible for and consolidated the code to make it consise and organized.

Overall, I have improved my understanding of html, css, and how to read the relationship between these files and the functions they are to execute on a web page. I have also gained valuable experience using GitHub and transfering files between GitHub and my local device. In learning all of this, I beleive I have been able to create a standout final product that is cleaner than what I found it and maintains the design and functionality of the original web page.

To look at the final product, please click on the following link: [Horiseon Refactor](https://glchavez.github.io/Horiseon-Refactor/)

## Usage

When loading the web page from the link referenced in the Description section of this README, you will see three navigation links in the top right of the page. When clicked, these links will re-direct you to the relevant part of the web page. Please reference the following screenshot of the web page.
